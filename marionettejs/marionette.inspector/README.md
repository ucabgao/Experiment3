### Functionality

The inspector makes it possible to understand how your App works, without needing to understand how all the code works. This is possible because everything's one click away. You'll be amazed at how quickly this changes everything.


+ **Visualize** the view hierarchy with the UI tree
+ **Visualize** application activity with a full history of actions
+ **Inspect** view ui, events, listeners, properties
+ **Inspect** model attributes, listeners, properties
+ **Explore** Radio channel events, requests, commands
+ **Explore** application with an inspector magnifying glass
+ **Jump** between the inspector elements and source panel with intelligent links


### Try it out on a live app!

Once you've installed the Chrome extension, open the DevTools, click on the "Marionette" tab, and inspect this app!

### Getting Started


#### Download it
The inspector should work out of the box with most setups. You can download it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marionette-inspector/fbgfjlockdhidoaempmjcddibjklhpka?hl=en).

#### Caveats
If you're either using `Browserify` or `Webpack` or not exposing `Backbone` & `Marionette` as globals, you'll need to add one block to your setup.

```js
if (window.__agent) {
  window.__agent.start(Backbone, Marionette);
}
```

> Note this line should be placed after all underscore, backbone, and marionette REQUIRES, but before Application or View classes are defined.

#### Frequently Asked Questions
If you have any additional questions, check out our [FAQ](https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette.inspector/blob/master/docs/faq.md).


#### Usage Analytics
The Inspector gathers usage analytics to better report on inspector statistics such as average weekly users and popular features as well as to report on marionette patterns such as library versions in usage and architectural / api patterns. If you would prefer to disable analytics it is easy to do so:

```js
if (window.__agent) {
  window.__agent.disableAnalytics = true;
}
```

### Play with it locally
Follows these these steps in the [Install Guide](docs/developing_locally.md) and you should be up and running in no time. Read the [agent](https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette.inspector/blob/master/docs/agent.md) overview to understand how the inspector gathers all the information.


### Open Source (a.k.a. you)

The inspector is built with 100% open source love. That means, we absolutely want your help and your passion. If you want to get involved, stop by and say hello [here](https://gitter.im/marionettejs/marionette.inspector). We've got tons of [help wanted](https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette.inspector/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tickets and would be be happy to setup a 30 minute [screenhero](https://screenhero.com/) pairing session to help you get started. Many of our contributions, even some of the best ones like the Activity pane, came from first time contributors.
